# Dynamic-Memory

> Write a C++ programme that will create a deck of playing cards. Your programme should:

+ Contain two classes, a Card class and a Deck class.
+ Demonstrate composition.
+ The card class should hold the card suit and the card value as private data members.
+ The deck class should store objects on the heap, namely 52 instantiated cards.
+ The deck class should use an STL container to organise your cards.
+ A player should be able to request a new deck of cards, have the cards shuffled, and ask for a user-defined number of cards to be dealt to the player.
+ The programme should be free from memory leaks, so create a custom copy constructor and a custom destructor for your deck class.
+ Demonstrate your knowledge of operator overloading by overloading an operator in the deck class.
+ Use separate .h and .cpp files for each of your classes.
+ Use a persistent game loop.
+ Output instructions and options to the player.
+ You will upload five files.  Use the following names: card.h, card.cpp, deck.h, deck.cpp and main.cpp.
